## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation of the `/api/website-data` API endpoint, which is designed to fetch and return website data.  Currently, this endpoint uses mock data for demonstration purposes.  The actual website scraping logic would be implemented in place of the mock data.


## 2. API Endpoint: GET /api/website-data

This endpoint accepts a URL as a query parameter and returns website data as a JSON object.

### 2.1 Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                  | Required |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| `url`      | String  | The URL of the website to scrape.            | Yes      |


### 2.2 Function Logic

The `GET` function performs the following steps:

1. **Extract URL from Request:** It retrieves the `url` query parameter from the incoming request using `new URL(request.url)`.
2. **Input Validation:** It checks if the `url` parameter is provided. If not, it returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.
3. **Data Fetching (Mock):** Currently, the function uses mock data (`mockData`).  In a production environment, this section would contain the implementation for scraping the website specified by the provided URL.
4. **Simulated API Call:** A simulated API call is implemented using `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))` to mimic an asynchronous operation with a one-second delay.  This would be replaced with actual API calls or website scraping logic in a real-world scenario.
5. **Return Data:** The function returns the fetched data (currently mock data) as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json()`.


### 2.3 Error Handling

The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during data fetching. If an error occurs, the function logs the error to the console and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response with an appropriate error message.

### 2.4 Algorithm Details

The core algorithm for this endpoint (once implemented) would involve these steps:

1. **URL Parsing & Validation:**  The provided URL would be parsed to ensure it's valid and accessible.  Error handling for invalid URLs or unreachable websites would be implemented.
2. **Web Scraping:**  A web scraping library (e.g., Cheerio, Puppeteer) would be used to fetch the HTML content of the specified URL. This would likely involve handling potential network errors, timeouts and rate limits.
3. **Data Extraction:**  The relevant data (e.g., company name, address, phone, email) would be extracted from the HTML using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.  This would require careful analysis of the target website's structure to identify the appropriate selectors.
4. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** The extracted data would then be cleaned and transformed into a structured format (e.g., JSON object) before being returned as the API response.  This might involve handling inconsistencies in data formats or missing data.
5. **Caching (Future Consideration):**  In a production system, a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache) should be implemented to reduce the load on the web scraping process and improve response times for frequently accessed URLs.

The current implementation uses mock data, so these steps are not yet implemented.  They are outlined here to provide context for the future development of the endpoint.
